## Page 1
- An introduction to the user about what the app does, and what information they will need to fill out.
## Page 2
- A page where the user fills out their personal information.
- Text input fields for name, email and phone number. Which are all saved to session storage when submitted.
- Radio buttons for selecting the user's gender.
## Page 3
- A page for the user to pick their prefered methods of communication.
- Options include email, messaging, phone calls, video calling and meeting inperson.
## Page 4
- A page where the user is presented with a survey with 8 questions, with radio buttons that allow them to pick between agree or disagree.
- These questions use the publically available NHS pages on various mental disorders to ask the user if they can relate to symptoms that are symptomatic of various mental disoreders.
- These mnetal disorders have "score" variables that change depending on the users input for the questions.
## Page 5
- A results page, which depending on the user's input to the questions on the previous page, will display a list of Pokemon sprites and their names from the PokeAPI, after the user selects the "get your results!" button.
- Due to restricted access to APIs that contain data on actual doctors. I chose to substitute them for Pokemon instead, from the PokeAPI. The sprites would represent profile pictures and the names would represent contact information about the doctors, such as their names, phone numbers and email addresses.
## Additional Details
- When looking at the code you will notice that there are two copies of the .JS and .HTML files, I'm not sure why there are two but they both seem to function the same. The only exception being that for some reason only one of them has a comment that directly references using the AnimalButtonsNavigation code from moodle to help with the navigation.
